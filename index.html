            <h3>SOME FACTS ABOUT ANIMAL </h3>

            <article class="fact-card">
                <h4> What do animals do for fun ?
                </h4>
                <br>
                <p>Many species of animals tend to do things that don’t serve a clear purpose in their lives. Because of that, it stands to reason that they do these things for enjoyment. For instance, dolphins are known to deliberately handle pufferfish
                    in order to get them to release their toxins. The only thing these toxins do to dolphins is cause them to hallucinate or, to put it simply, get them high. There are many more examples, from cats chasing lasers to crocodiles swimming
                    with their smaller companions on their back.

                <h4>Which animal is the laziest ?</h4>
                <br>
                <p> It’s hard to choose the laziest animal, but there are certainly several contenders. These include pygmy blue tongue lizards, lemurs, pigs, giant pandas, owl monkeys, hippos, house cats, koalas, and of course, sloths. The main factors considered
                    are the number of hours they spend asleep and the amount of energy they use for fulfilling their needs.

                <h4>Why should animal be kept in zoos ?</h4>
                <br>
                <p> Humans have been keeping wild animals in captivity for hundreds if not thousands of years. However, that doesn’t mean it’s morally right to do so, nor is it suitable for animals.It’s becoming hard to justify keeping animals in captivity,
                    but there are still a few reasons why this is the right choice such as Zoos save endangered species of animals by keeping them protected from predators, poachers, and hostile environments. Bringing people and animals together can help
                    educate the public about the importance of animals in our ecosystem.</ </p>

                        <h2>Definition of Animal</h2>
                        <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic
                            stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated
                            there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food
                            webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.</p>

                    <section id="section2">
                        <p>Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have
                            birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.</p>

                    <section id="section3">
                        <p>Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on how they obtain or consume organic material, including carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, detritivores, and parasites. Interactions between animals form complex food webs.
                            In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer–resource interaction where a predator feeds on another organism (called its prey). Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between
                            predator and prey, resulting in various anti-predator adaptations. Almost all multicellular predators are animals. Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts' living
                            tissues, killing them in the process, but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers. Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges. -Wikipedia</p>

                        <h2>Symbology of Animal</h2>
                        <p>Have you ever wondered why we often use metaphorical references while talking? Like referring to a person and saying that he is as wise as an owl or that he is as courageous as a lion. This is just a result of the use of animal
                            symbolism. Using symbology associated with animals in everyday life is a tradition that can be traced back several years. Today these symbols are deeply entrenched in our consciousness. The origin of this form of symbology
                            can be traced to mythology and religious symbols. According to the many studies of animal symbology according to different cultures, you will see that there are certain animals that are associated with secret codes and deep
                            meanings. While there are other characteristics that are less secretive and more of an open book, perceptible even by the most unobservant observer.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section id="section2">
                        <p>Why is this type of symbolism as important as it is? Well, if you think about it seriously, you will see that the symbology associated with different animals play a huge part in our lives. There is always a certain association
                            with personality traits and animals. In many cultures like the Native American culture, the Japanese, and the Chinese, there is a strong belief in the rebirth and resurrection of life and the association with animals in previous
                            life. Most cultures believe that this symbology and discovering our animal totem (our relationship with a specific animal) can help us understand more about our past life, and in some cases things about our future as well.
                            In the table that is given below, we give you a list of the different personality traits that are traditionally associated with different animals. While this may vary greatly according to cultural differences, these are some
                            of the most widely accepted associations. -Mysticurious</p>
